## The Industry’s Biggest Mistake
Most RCM tools are built around the *payer*, not the *provider*.  
This creates friction, inefficiency, and avoidable revenue leakage.

## Provider-Centric Design Solves Everything
MEDVOXA aligns automation with:
- provider documentation style  
- specialty-specific coding patterns  
- local payer behavior  
- encounter-to-claim accuracy  

## Result
Providers see increased revenue with **less administrative effort**.
