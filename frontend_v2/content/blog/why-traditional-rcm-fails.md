## The Harsh Reality
Traditional RCM was built for an era before:
- payer complexity  
- compliance inflation  
- telehealth scaling  
- multi-location networks  

It simply cannot keep up.

## The AI Replacement Layer
AI fixes systemic failures by:
- detecting errors proactively  
- generating cleaner claims  
- adapting to payer changes  
- reducing manual workloads  

## Bottom Line
AI doesn’t “support” RCM — it **rebuilds it** for the modern provider.
